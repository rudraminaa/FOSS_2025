A calculator is an electronic or mechanical device designed to perform mathematical operations automatically, ranging from basic arithmetic like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to more complex functions such as trigonometry, logarithms, and graphing.
 Modern electronic calculators, which became popular in the mid-1970s due to advancements in integrated circuits, are typically portable and use batteries or solar cells for power.
 They feature a keypad for input, a display (often LCD) for output, and a processor chip that executes calculations using built-in programs stored in permanent memory.
 While basic calculators handle simple operations, specialized types include scientific calculators for advanced math, graphing calculators for visualizing functions, and financial calculators for tasks like mortgage and investment calculations.
